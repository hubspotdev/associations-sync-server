# Associations Mappings Server

This Express.js application provides a solution for integrating with HubSpot to manage associations between various CRM objects. The application handles the seamless creation, retrieval, deletion, and mapping of associations and definitions, while also enabling OAuth-based authentication with HubSpot.
- **Associations** in HubSpot refer to the connections or relationships between different CRM objects. For instance, a contact can be associated with a company, a deal, or a custom object
- **Association mapping** refers to the configuration process where users set up the rules or criteria that define how associations are created between different CRM objects.
- **Association definition** involves specifying the nature and characteristics of the association between objects


## Why is this project useful
- Comprehensive API Management: Provides endpoints for managing associations and definitions between CRM objects, allowing for complex relationship handling.
- Authentication Handling: Manages OAuth authentication, streamlining the process of securely connecting to HubSpot's API.
- Data Consistency: Ensures data consistency across platforms by handling interactions with both a local database and HubSpot.

## Getting started with the project:
### Setup:
- Download and install PostgreSQL, make sure it's running, and create an empty database. You need the username and password (defaults username is postgres and no password)
- Clone the repo
- Create the `.env` file with these entries:
    - `DATABASE_URL` the (local) url to the postgres database (e.g. `postgresql://{username}:{password}@localhost:5432/{database name}`)
    - `CLIENT_ID` from Hubspot public app
    - `CLIENT_SECRET` from Hubspot public app
- Run `npm install` to install the required Node packages.
- In your HubSpot public app, add `localhost:3001/api/install/oauth-callback` as a redirect URL
- The app uses the following scopes:
    crm.objects.companies.read
    crm.objects.companies.write
    crm.objects.contacts.read
    crm.objects.contacts.write
    crm.objects.deals.read
    crm.objects.deals.write
    oauth
- Run `npm run dev` to start the server
- Visit `http://localhost:3001/api/install` in a browser to get the OAuth install link
- Run `npm run seed` to seed the database with test data, select an industry for the data examples
- Once the server is running, you can access the application and API documentation at `http://localhost:3001/api-docs`.
